Our tutorial begins with a crucial emphasis on establishing the essential software infrastructure required for this automation. We'll not only navigate through the login process but also uncover how to search for colleagues. It's worth noting that my inspiration and majority of the code for this tutorial comes from PythonSimplified (you can find the video here), and our chosen tool for automation is Selenium, paired with the versatile Chrome web browser.\n",
