    "##  Completing LinkedIn Automation Script for Sending Connection Requests\n",
    "\n",

    "1. To complete our automation, we store this search for coworkers and colleagues who work at NCSR Demokritos in a variable called search_url and use the `driver.get()` method to open it.\n",

    "2. **We loop through pages**:  (adjustable range) to perform the following actions for each page:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.1 `all_buttons = driver.find_elements(By.XPATH, \"//button\")`: Inside the loop, we uses Selenium's wait.until() method to wait for the presence of all buttons on the page (using an XPath selector). This ensures that the page has loaded before proceeding. Our intension is to find the `Connect buttons` (to click on in order to send the request) from the the all_buttons list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.2`connect_buttons = [btn for btn in all_buttons if btn.text == \"Connect\"]`:  Creates a new list called connect_buttons using a list comprehension. It iterates through each element in the all_buttons list (which contains all the button elements on the page) and checks if the text of each button is equal to \"Connect.\" If a button's text is \"Connect,\" it is included in the connect_buttons list (these are the buttons we want to click to send connection requests on LinkedIn).    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.3 If there are \"Connect\" buttons found (`if connect_buttons:`), it enters another loop to iterate over these buttons. For each \"Connect\" button:  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        2.3.1 It clicks the \"Connect\" button using `driver.execute_script()`.  \n",
    "        2.3.2 It finds and clicks the \"Send now\" button and the \"close\" button, both using `driver.execute_script()`. We use JavaScript in order to avoid LinkedIn blockers.   \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.4  If there are no \"Connect\" buttons (`else:`), it finds \"Next\" button (from the list all_buttons) and clicks it. This helps to navigate to the next page of search results.\n",

    "\n",
    "This Python script utilizes the Selenium library to automate interactions with LinkedIn, specifically for sending connection requests. It begins by initializing the ChromeDriver and navigating to LinkedIn's home page, where it enters the login credentials and logs in. The script then iterates through search result pages, locating and clicking the 'Connect' buttons on profiles. After each click, it sends a connection request, dismisses the request dialog, and acknowledges any informational dialog. Delays are included to ensure smooth interactions; you can adjust them as needed. If no 'Connect' buttons are found on a page, the script proceeds to the next."
